# 📌 Payroll Deductions Automation (Power Query Version)

## 📍 Project Overview
This project automates the transformation of employee deduction data into a payroll-ready format for the **Metiri payroll system**, using **Microsoft Power Query** in Excel.

It reads raw Excel input files, reshapes the data, applies deduction code mapping, and produces a structured dataset ready for TXT export and system import.

---

## ⚙️ What the automation does
- Imports a source Excel file with employee deductions  
- Cleans and standardizes fields (missing values, numeric formats)
- Converts data from **wide → long** layout
- Maps deduction names to payroll system codes
- Adds payroll metadata (date range, quantity, installment)
- Produces a table ready for `.txt` export (semicolon `;` separated)

   - `FilePath_CodeMapping`
   - `StartDate`
   - `FinalDate`
4. Go to **Data → Refresh All**
5. Review the `Final Output` table and export it to `.csv` using semicolon delimiters

### 🛠️ Configuration Section
